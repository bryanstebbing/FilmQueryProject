# FilmQueryProject

# Description
In this project we were tasked with using a Java program to read data from separate databases and display the results based on pre-determined parameters. This assignment dealt with tables relating to films, actors, and the associated languages the films played in. The goal was to create two methods which determined how the user wanted to search for a particular film. The first method receives a number input which correlates to a film id. This id is used to search the database for a matching film id and then display the films title, description, release year, language, and actors portrayed in the film, are then displayed. The second method took in a keyword from the user which would then return all the films with who matched with the users input. 

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Google, Sublime, MySQL, Maven, Git, GitHub, Terminal, and MAMP.

# Lessons Learned
In this project I learned an enumerable amount of ways not to write SQL scripts. It was by far one of the more challenging aspects of this project as it wasn't as simple as write and run. It was write, run, get an error message, write again, run, get an error message. Learning the syntax and finding easier ways to get a prompt to the SQL database was challenging and rewarding. The next challenge was understanding the relationships between the classes, the methods, the connections, and sets, and statements, and making sure they are all working cohesively.
